# editable_profile

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is an editable profile application with different pages for each field.
This project borrows heavily from and uses Johannes Milke's User Profile and User Shared Preferences projects as bases: they can be found here: 

https://github.com/JohannesMilke/user_profile_shared_preferences_example
https://github.com/JohannesMilke/user_profile_ii_example

instead of a profile card and an edit page, it switches to an individual page to edit each aspect of the profile. This project is incomplete as some functionality has not been achieved, such as properly storing and changing the profile based on the edits.

To Run, Have flutter installed, set up the desired mobile emulator, and put "Flutter Run" in the terminal. If you are using VSCode, you can just do Run -> Start Debugging
